# axePrototype

A prototype I created to see if I could recreate the axe throw and return mechanic from God of War (2018).

Axe asset created by me. All other player models and animations are from <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/"> Mixamo </a>.

This version includes throwing and recalling the axe, with it being able to stick into a surface waiting to be recalled and rotating as it flies through the air as in the full game.

## Controls
- WASD for movement
- Traditional TP Mouse Look
- Left click to throw axe
- R Key to recall axe

## TODO:
Features that I would like to add include: An aiming mode, a wobble to simulate weight when recalling from a stuck surface and AI to attack with the throw.
